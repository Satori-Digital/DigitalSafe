File crypt is an encryption app that allows anyone to encrypt files and folders

All files are saved in dist -> FILECRYPT -> Encrypted

Make Sure when decrypting to decrypt encrypted file and not original file (Common Mistake)

Your key is located in dist -> FILECRYPT -> Keystore & is what is used to encrypt your data.

if you lose key, data will be unrecoverable
